# Graphics Experiment

Where to go next:
- check out `SDL_Vertex` - `SDL_RenderGeometry`
- make some other rectangles and stuff (?) - world system
- add the error polling thing for textures and rectangles and stuff
- move game loop to own system

- perhaps use binary system for ppms    = o or some other compression
