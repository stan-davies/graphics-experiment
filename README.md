# Graphics Experiment

Where to go next:
- check out `SDL_Vertex` - `SDL_RenderGeometry`
- make some other rectangles and stuff (?) - world system
- seperate constants from init/dest functions
- split up `main.c`
- add the error polling thing
- some kind of logging system

- might need to customise ppm format to allow for alpha channel - most likely
  only need alpha of 255, in which case no colour, so could replace whole pixel
  with 'a'
- perhaps also use binary system    = o or some other compression


- Sort out loading of textures with bogus values.
